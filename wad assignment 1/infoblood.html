	<h4>Pre Donation Screening</h4>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"># During pre-donation screening, a blood bank employee will ask you some questions about your health, lifestyle, and disease risk factors. All of this information is confidential.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> # An employee will perform a short health exam, taking your pulse, temperature and blood pressure. A drop of blood from your finger will also be tested to ensure that your blood iron level is sufficient for you to donate.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> # All medical equipment used for this test, as well as during the donation process, is sterile, used only once and then disposed.</p>
